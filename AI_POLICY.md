# AI Usage Policy

We have strict rules for AI usage:

- **All AI usage in any form must be disclosed.** 
  You must state the tool(s) you used along with the extent that the work was AI-assisted.

- **Pull requests created in any way by AI can only be for accepted issues.** 
  Drive-by pull requests that do not reference an accepted issue will be closed. 
  If AI isn't disclosed but a we suspects its use, the PR will be closed.   

- **Pull requests created by AI must have been fully verified with human use.** 
  AI must not create hypothetically correct code that hasn't been tested. 
  Importantly, you must not allow AI to write code for platforms or environments you don't have access to manually test on.

- **Issues and discussions can use AI assistance but must have a full human-in-the-loop.** 
  This means that any content generated with AI must have been reviewed _and edited_ by a human before submission.
